# Spotify Playlist Sorting
My first time working with the Spotify API, the spotipy library and my first python project. This project takes all of my liked songs in spotify (1000+) and sorts them into new playlists based off of the college semester I was in when I saved the song. By doing this, I now have a playlist for every college semester and in them the songs I added during that time. This is useful as it helps me keep track of what my favorite songs were during each school term, and helps me reminisce on my time in college :)
